#Installation
R can be installed on all platforms without problems.  There are versions and archives available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  To download R, visit https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and select the location closest to you.  CRAN refers to the Comprehensive R Archive Network, a network of universities and other institutions that store and manage copies of R and its packages, called mirrors.

The R installation contains the R app, a perfectly suitable workspace, however R Studio comes highly recommended for its streamlined interface and environment display.  

Programs are run in the R workspace and require no boiler plate. Although it is not boiler plate, the command "dir.create" followed by a name is useful as it allows you to create a directory to hold all the files for a particular program.

Other useful starter information includes the separation of commands using the semi-colon(;) as well as the enacting of comments through a hashtag(#) with everything to the end of the line being a comment.
