#R
R was created in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman of the University of Auckland, New Zealand.  R is considered to be an implementation of S, developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and his colleagues.  R is a specification for statistcal computing and graphics.

R is interpreted (not compiled) and a combination structural and object-oriented language. More specifically, R is referred to as a procedural programing langauge for its use of functions of simple computational steps.

R is most commonly used for statistical and graphical techniques, analysis and modeling.  R is known for its extensive collection of user designed packages which expand the possible uses of R.  These packages allow the use of specialized statistical techniques and data analysis.  Packages have even been developed for use in the analysis of genomic data.

Given the wide range of uses of R, the most popular uses still remain in statistical computing and graphics.  The most popular projects in GitHub are Implementation of the Grammar of Graphics, Easy interactive web applications with R, and :mortar_board: A collection of interactive courses for the swirl R package.

This semester I will utilize the manuals from the R Core Team, the developers of the language, in addition to the packages and information found on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
